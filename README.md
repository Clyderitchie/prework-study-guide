# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My purpose for this Prework Study Guide was to give other bootcamp students a centralized resource to study the topics they need to know before the class starts.
- This webpage was built in order to benifit a bootcamp student who is looking for a place to study the notes before class starts.
- With this Prework Study Guide being all on one webpage, it elminates the need of multiple webpages to study all the topics a student needs.
- While building this webpage I was able to learn about GitHub, the CLI, and different styles of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and what each one does.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used to help a bootcamp student study and understand topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how to work with a GitHub. Through this study guide the user can even learn how to use developer tools to see how JavaScript works in action! They can even interact with the JS to see which topic they should study during that time too!
